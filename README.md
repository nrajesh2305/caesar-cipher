# Caesar Hacker

# How to Use:

Enter the choice of whether or not you would like to decrypt or encrypt your message.

Both decrypting and encrypting requires the individual to input a key.
The KEY is the amount of shifting each letter in your message takes.

For example, if my key is 4, and the first letter of my message is A,
the letter A is replaced by E, because we move forward 4 times.

When decrypting the message, the same occurs mostly, however your letters are shifted by the key in the opposite direction:

For example: The letter D becomes Z because we move backwards 4 times, 4 being the key.

This decryption technique will mostly take multiple tries to figure out what the correct key is that makes the message make sense. This will be solved when you use the Caesar Hacker Solver, which is a separate project I have made on the side.

This would run multiple keys from 1-26 and then it is up to you to find which message makes sense out of all the outputs.

Enjoy using the Caesar Hacker!
